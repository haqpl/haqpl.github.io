title: About me
---

I’m a security enthusiast and technology polyglot, pug lover and drum’n’bass head. I was sixteen when I found a vulnerability in the biggest Polish mainstream portal and then got hired. I was mixing vinyls in legendary Lodz music club and still, it is not enough for me!

I specialize in web application penetration testing but red-teaming is also my cup of tea.

> Conquer the world is my "motto" :)

Currently based in Lodz, Poland. Looking for remote job opportunities!
