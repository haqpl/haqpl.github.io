title: About me
---

I’m a security ninja and technology polyglot, pug lover and drum’n’bass head. I was sixteen when I found a vulnerability in the biggest Polish mainstream portal and then was hired. I was mixing vinyls with New Breed Crew MC’s in legendary Lodz music club and still it is not enough for me!

Currently based in Lodz, Poland.
