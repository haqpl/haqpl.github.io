title: About me
---

I'm security ninja and technology polyglot. Pug lover and drum'n'bass head! I was sixteen when I found a vulnerability in the biggest Polish mainstream portal and then was hired. I was mixing vinyls with New Breed Crew MC's in legendary Lodz club and there and it is still not enough for me!

> Conquer the world is my motto! :)

Currently based in Lodz, Poland.
