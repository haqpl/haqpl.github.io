title: Communication between page script and Firefox extension

### [](#header-3)The problem:

Few days ago I wrote a tool which automates Knoxss extension. In the beginning my tool was not able to communicate with extension so I couldn't read its status and so on. The problem was that every solution I found described communication from HTML page to extension but I needed something oposite. Second problem: I'm not a JavaScript programmer :)

### What I found:

* [Communication between HTML and your extension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/Add-ons/Communication_between_HTML_and_your_extension) - described usage of Custom events which gave me an idea of trying it
